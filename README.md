# SurveyWords
An R function to work with the words from recent surveys

The free form  results from a survey are often badly stated, full of stop words, and need cleaning. The purpose of this function is to have an easy piece of code that can be given a vector of strings, clean it, and then from that extract some basioc measures that are going to be used later on in the survey analysis.

Furhermore we want to go besides thefamous wordcloud, and incliude some other analysis of the words beyond the frequency and their change of use over the years. Perhaps their meaning, or the ability to imply other situations.

Finally, there is a correlation between authorship and their success while in power, but that can be explored later.
