# SurveyWords
An R function to work with the words from recent surveys

The free form  results from a survey are often badly stated, full of stop words, and need cleaning. The purpose of this function is to have an easy piece of code that can be given a vector of strings, clean it, and then from that extract some basioc measures that are going to be used later on in the survey analysis.
